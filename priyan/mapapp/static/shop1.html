        <h4>Murugan Idli Shop is a popular chain of vegetarian restaurants in Tamil Nadu, known for its South Indian cuisine like idli, dosa, and jigirthanda. Its origin is a family story from Madurai, where the owner's mother began making idlis to supplement the income of their original coffee shop, leading to the establishment of the now-famous restaurant. The shop is known for its authenticity and has multiple branches in Chennai and even in Singapore. </h4>
