        The Krishnagiri Reservoir Project (KRP) Dam is a major irrigation dam in Tamil Nadu's Krishnagiri district, built between 1955 and 1957 across the Thenpennai River. Its key facts include providing irrigation for thousands of acres, a gross storage capacity of \(47.156\) MCM (million cubic meters), and being a popular tourist spot with a park that features gardens, fountains, and a children's play area. The dam was inaugurated by former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj.
